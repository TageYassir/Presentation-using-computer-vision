# 🎯 Hands-Free Presentation Controller

Welcome to the **Hands-Free Presentation Controller** — a simple and efficient tool designed to simplify class presentations using gesture control.

---

## 💡 Project Idea

The inspiration for this project comes from the common frustration of always needing to stay near your computer to switch slides during a presentation. While remotes exist, they can be unreliable — requiring batteries or occasionally malfunctioning.

This project offers an alternative: **control your slides with hand gestures** using your webcam.

---

## 🖥️ How It Works

The application uses computer vision and hand-tracking to detect gestures and move through presentation slides accordingly.

To ensure smooth functionality, slides must be prepared in a specific format:
1. Images should be in **PNG** format.
2. Filenames should be **numbered sequentially**: `1.png`, `2.png`, `3.png`, etc.

To help with that, we provide a user-friendly interface that:
- Uncompresses slides file if needed.
- Converts images from JPG to PNG.
- Renames slides in the correct numeric format.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Main Libraries Used
- [`cvzone`](https://pypi.org/project/cvzone/): For predefined hand-tracking functionality  
  Install with:  
  ```bash
  pip install cvzone
  ```
- `opencv-python`: For camera and image processing
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `tkinter`: For the graphical user interface (GUI) (usually pre-installed with Python)
- `PIL (Pillow)`: For image processing
- `zipfile`: For uncompressing image slides

---

## 🧰 Features

- ✅ Unzip the slides folder
- ✅ Convert JPG to PNG
- ✅ Rename slides to sequential numbers (e.g., `1.png`, `2.png`, ...)
- ✅ Choose to lanch the app with a cam or not.
- ✅ Use hand gestures to go forward/backward through slides
- ✅ Simple and intuitive interface using Tkinter

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TageYassir/Presentation-using-computer-vision.git
   cd hands-free-presentation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install cvzone opencv-python numpy pillow
   ```

3. (Optional) Install `tkinter` if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # For Linux
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Launch the interface to prepare your slides.
2. Use the interface buttons to:
3. - Uncompress the slide set
   - Convert images
   - Rename them
4. Run the main presentation script.
5. Use your hand gestures to control slide progression.
